"""
The Cobweb module contains the :class:`CobwebTree` and :class:`CobwebNode`
classes which are used to achieve the basic Cobweb functionality.

The Cobweb module specialized for RSA framework adjusts and adds some features:

When fitting a new instance into a tree, 
Not onlt the counts of some node will be updated, the whole instance will also be stored in the node.
However, when updating the counts of a CobwebNode with the new instance,
only the attributes that is not classification will be fitted into the nodes.
So when calculating the utilities and choosing from the adjustments of the tree,
classifications will always NOT be considered.

To see the corresponding adjustments, see:
-> CobwebNode.__init__()
-> CobwebNode.increment_counts(instance, instance_with_c=None)
-> CobwebNode.create_new_child(instance, instance_with_c=None)
-> CobwebTree.cobweb(instance)

        The core cobweb algorithm used in fitting and categorization.

        In the general case, the cobweb algorithm entertains a number of

        that maximizes the :meth:`category utility
        <CobwebNode.category_utility>` of the tree at the current node and then
        recurses.

        At each node the alogrithm first calculates the category utility of
        inserting the instance at each of the node's children, keeping the best
        two (see: :meth:`CobwebNode.two_best_children
        <CobwebNode.two_best_children>`), and then calculates the
        category_utility of performing other operations using the best two
        children (see: :meth:`CobwebNode.get_best_operation
        <CobwebNode.get_best_operation>`), commiting to whichever operation
        results in the highest category utility. In the case of ties an
        operation is chosen at random.

        In the base case, i.e. a leaf node, the algorithm checks to see if
        the current leaf is an exact match to the current node. If it is, then
        the instance is inserted and the leaf is returned. Otherwise, a new
        leaf is created.

        used to determine which insert operation is best. The relative CU can
        be computed from the CU using the following transformation.

        By computing relative_CU scores instead of CU scores for each insert
        operation, the time complexity of the underlying Cobweb algorithm is
        reduced from :math:`O(B^2 \\times log_B(n) \\times AV)` to
        :math:`O(B \\times log_B(n) \\times AV)` where :math:`B` is the average
